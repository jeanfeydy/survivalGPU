The survivalGPU library allows you to perform survival analyzes using the resources of Graphic Processing Units (GPU) in order to accelerate the speed of calculations. Currently, two models have been implemented :  

* `coxphGPU()` for Cox[^cox1] [^cox2] model  
* `wceGPU()` for Weighted Cumulative Exposure[^wce] model  

It's also possible to use the library without having Graphics Processing Units (with CPU).

## Installation

### Requirements

Python packages :  

* pytorch
* pytorch-scatter
* pykeops (for WCE model)

Actually, survivalGPU is not available for Windows.  

survivalGPU require submodules : you can install the development version of survivalGPU from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with `install_git_with_submodule()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")

install_git_with_submodule <- function(x, subdir) {
  install_dir <- tempfile()
  system(paste("git clone --recursive", shQuote(x), shQuote(install_dir)))
  
  # change name for windows install
  file.rename(file.path(install_dir,"R/inst/python/survivalgpu"),
              file.path(install_dir,"R/inst/python/survivalgpu_submodule"))
  file.copy(file.path(install_dir,"python/survivalgpu"),
            file.path(install_dir,"R/inst/python"), recursive=TRUE)
  
  devtools::install(file.path(file.path(install_dir,subdir)))
}

install_git_with_submodule("https://github.com/jeanfeydy/survivalGPU",
                           subdir="R")
```

> **Warning**: survivalGPU is a package dependant of python, and it's necessary to have installed the `reticulate` R package. To manage your python or miniconda configuration, check vignette("python_connect").

## Examples

Let's make an example with `drugdata` dataset from WCE package.

```{r example}
library(survivalGPU)
library(survival)
library(WCE)
data(drugdata)
```

By default, functions run with GPU if detected. Then we specify the number of bootstrap, and consequently the batchsize argument, according to CUDA drivers detection.

```{r}
if (use_cuda()) {
  n_bootstrap <- 1000
  batchsize <- 200
} else {
  n_bootstrap <- 50
  batchsize <- 10
}
```


### Cox

You can realize the Cox model with the `coxphGPU` function, which is written in the same way as the `survival::coxph` function from survival package, with a Surv object in the formula, containing Start, Stop and Event variables.

```{r coxphGPU}
coxphGPU_bootstrap <- coxphGPU(Surv(Start, Stop, Event) ~ sex + age,
  data = drugdata,
  bootstrap = n_bootstrap,
  batchsize = batchsize
)
```

You obtain with `summary` all results for initial model, and a confidence interval for estimated coefficients with bootstrap. 

```{r}
summary(coxphGPU_bootstrap)
```


### WCE

WCE allows modeling the cumulative effects of time-varying exposures, weighted according to their relative proximity in time and represented by time-dependent covariates. Currently, the weight function is estimated by the Cox proportional hazards model. To build a model, you can use the `wceGPU` function in the same way as the `WCE::WCE` function from WCE package.

```{r wceGPU}
wce_gpu_bootstrap <- wceGPU(
  data = drugdata, nknots = 1, cutoff = 90, id = "Id",
  event = "Event", start = "Start", stop = "Stop",
  expos = "dose", covariates = c("age", "sex"),
  constrained = FALSE, aic = FALSE, confint = 0.95,
  nbootstraps = n_bootstrap, batchsize = batchsize
)
```

In the summary, there are estimated coefficients for the covariates with his confidence interval, calculated with var-covariance matrix, and information to see the significance of the covariates. It's also possible to have confidence interval with bootstrap.

```{r}
summary(wce_gpu_bootstrap)
```

The risk function can be plot, and if you added bootstrap, confidence band intervals will be visible.

```{r wceGPU_plot}
plot(wce_gpu_bootstrap)
```
