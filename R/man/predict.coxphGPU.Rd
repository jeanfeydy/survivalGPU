\arguments{
\item{object}{coxphGPU object}

\item{newdata}{Optional new data at which to do predictions. If absent
predictions are for the data frame used in the original fit. When coxph has
been called with a formula argument created in another context, i.e., coxph
has been called within another function and the formula was passed as an
argument to that function, there can be problems finding the data set.}

\item{type}{the type of predicted value. Choices are the linear predictor
("lp"), the risk score exp(lp) ("risk"), the expected number of events
given the covariates and follow-up time ("expected"), and the terms of the
linear predictor ("terms"). The survival probability for a subject is equal
to exp(-expected).}

\item{se.fit}{if TRUE, pointwise standard errors are produced for the
predictions.}

\item{na.action}{applies only when the newdata argument is present, and
defines the missing value action for the new data. The default is to
include all observations. When there is no newdata, then the behavior of
missing is dictated by the na.action option of the original fit.}

\item{terms}{if type="terms", this argument can be used to specify which
terms should be included; the default is all.}

\item{collapse}{optional vector of subject identifiers. If specified, the
output will contain one entry per subject rather than one entry per
observation.}

\item{reference}{reference for centering predictions}

\item{...}{for methods}
