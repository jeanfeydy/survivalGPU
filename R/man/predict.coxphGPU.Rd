\usage{
\method{predict}{coxphGPU}(
  object,
  newdata,
  type = c("lp", "risk", "expected", "terms", "survival"),
  se.fit = FALSE,
  na.action = na.pass,
  terms = names(object$assign),
  collapse,
  reference = c("strata", "sample", "zero"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{the results of a coxphGPU fit.}

\item{newdata}{
  Optional new data at which to do predictions.
  If absent predictions are for the  data frame used in the original
  fit. 
  When coxph has been called with a formula argument created in another
  context, i.e., coxph has been called within another function and the
  formula was passed as an argument to that function, there can be
  problems finding the data set.  See the note below.
}

\item{type}{
the type of predicted value. 
Choices are the linear predictor (\code{"lp"}), the risk score exp(lp)
(\code{"risk"}), 
the expected number of events given the covariates and follow-up time 
(\code{"expected"}), and the terms of the linear predictor
(\code{"terms"}).
The survival probability for a subject is equal to exp(-expected).
}

\item{se.fit}{
if TRUE, pointwise standard errors are produced for the predictions. 
}

\item{na.action}{
  applies only when the \code{newdata} argument is present, and defines
  the missing value action for the new data.  The default is to include
  all observations.
  When there is no newdata, then the behavior of missing is dictated by
  the na.action option of the original fit.}

\item{terms}{
if type="terms", this argument can be used to specify which terms should be 
included; the default is all. 
}

\item{collapse}{
optional vector of subject identifiers.  
If specified, the output will contain one entry per subject rather than one 
entry per observation. 
}

\item{reference}{reference for centering predictions, see details below}

\item{...}{For future methods}
}
