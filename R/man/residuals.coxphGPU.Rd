\usage{
\method{residuals}{coxphGPU}(
  object,
  ...,
  type = c("martingale", "deviance", "score", "schoenfeld", "dfbeta", "dfbetas",
    "scaledsch", "partial"),
  collapse = FALSE,
  weighted = (type \%in\% c("dfbeta", "dfbetas"))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{
an object inheriting from class \code{coxph}, representing a fitted Cox
regression model.
Typically this is the output from the \code{coxph} function.
}

\item{...}{other unused arguments}

\item{type}{
character string indicating the type of residual desired.
Possible values are \code{"martingale"}, \code{"deviance"}, \code{"score"}, \code{"schoenfeld"},
"dfbeta"', \code{"dfbetas"}, \code{"scaledsch"} and \code{"partial"}.
Only enough of the string to determine a unique match is required.
}

\item{collapse}{
vector indicating which rows to collapse (sum) over.
In time-dependent models more than one row data can pertain
to a single individual.
If there were 4 individuals represented by 3, 1, 2 and 4 rows of data
respectively, then \code{collapse=c(1,1,1, 2, 3,3, 4,4,4,4)} could be used to
obtain per subject rather than per observation residuals.
}

\item{weighted}{
if \code{TRUE} and the model was fit with case weights, then the weighted
residuals are returned.
}
}
\description{
Calculates martingale, deviance, score or Schoenfeld residuals for a
Cox proportional hazards model.
