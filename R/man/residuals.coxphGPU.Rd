\usage{
\method{residuals}{coxphGPU}(
  object,
  ...,
  type = c("martingale", "deviance", "score", "schoenfeld", "dfbeta", "dfbetas",
    "scaledsch", "partial"),
  collapse = FALSE,
  weighted = (type \%in\% c("dfbeta", "dfbetas"))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{coxphGPU object.}

\item{...}{additional argument(s) for methods.}

\item{type}{character string indicating the type of residual desired.
Possible values are "martingale", "deviance", "score", "schoenfeld",
"dfbeta"', "dfbetas", "scaledsch" and "partial". Only enough of the string
to determine a unique match is required.}

\item{collapse}{vector indicating which rows to collapse (sum) over. In
time-dependent models more than one row data can pertain to a single
individual. If there were 4 individuals represented by 3, 1, 2 and 4 rows
of data respectively, then collapse=c(1,1,1, 2, 3,3, 4,4,4,4) could be used
to obtain per subject rather than per observation residuals.}

\item{weighted}{if TRUE and the model was fit with case weights, then the
weighted residuals are returned.}
}
\description{
Calculates martingale, deviance, score or Schoenfeld residuals for a Cox
proportional hazards model.
